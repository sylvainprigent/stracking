"""
Bio-image analysis module for Python
====================================

stracking is a Python module for particles tracking based on the scientific
ecosystem in python  (numpy, scipy, scikit-image).

See http://github.com/sylvainprigent/stracking for complete documentation.

# libraries to be loaded. It should not degrade performances since we manually
# take care of potential over-subcription performance issues, in sections of
# the code where nested OpenMP loops can happen, by dynamically reconfiguring
# the inner OpenMP runtime to temporarily disable it while under the scope of
# the outer OpenMP parallel section.
